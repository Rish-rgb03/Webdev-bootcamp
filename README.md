The Website I created is about Food to make when one is in a budget . The list of the pages are :
1. Website.html
2. Dal Chawal.html
3. Poori And Chole.html
4. Chicken Curry.html
5. Varieties of maggi.html
6. Chatpata Bhel.html
7. https://github.com/Rish-rgb03/Webdev-bootcamp/blob/main/Website.html


I have also added images and also a css file nown as style.css in which various styles have been added for the texts.
The idea of the website is still unpolished , I just thought of random dishes but I tries to use as many tags as possible to implement.
